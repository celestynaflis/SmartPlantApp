# SmartPlantApp 🌿

#### ⚠️ Note: This is the first React app I've ever made. I’m aware that it's far from perfect — it's a student project that requires solid refactor.

React Native App I wrote as Engineering Thesis together with 3 other students. Two of us were creating frontend, and two backend. 
I was responsible for frontend implementation, preparing database and I have created designs of the entire application.

## 📘 What is it about?

The SmartPlant application provides users with basic information about plant care. It also includes soil moisture monitoring using Arduino moisture sensors. Additionally, users have access to an encyclopedia of 406 plant species, where they can find detailed care instructions. The app helps users organize their observations and structure plant-related information. It also displays optimal humidity parameters for each species and provides educational content about their care.

### 🎯 Purpose

The SmartPlant app was designed to make caring for potted plants easier. Keeping live plants at home has become an increasingly popular trend, especially for aesthetic reasons. However, many plant owners are not familiar with proper plant care and often don’t have the time or motivation to learn. As a result, they may lack the knowledge needed to keep their plants healthy.
